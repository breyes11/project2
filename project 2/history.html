						The History
					</div>
				<div class="item2">This rivalry has been happening for the past 62 years. It all started when the then Minneapolis Lakers were swept by the Boston Celtics(4-0), which resulted in the first sweep in History of the NBA Finals. Although, that might seem bad this just started the best rivalry in NBA history. The Lakers were determined to defeat the Boston Celtics with all their might they continued to hustle in order to defeat them. The Lakers went on to face the Celtics the next year. Still with the Celtics dominating the league the Lakers did not give up. They both dominated the league in the 60s. Once the 80s rolled around a freshly new Laker team had busted their behinds to defeat the Celtics. In that very are the Lakers had won multiple rings defeating the Celtics..</div>
				<div class="item3">With determination the 1980s Lakers had started an era where the Lakers beat the celtics at almost every meeting between the two. In the most recent NBA Finals meeting the 2010 Lakers had overthrown the Celtics. With Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace (aka Ronald Artest) they were able to beat the celtics and added another ring for their franchise. No matter what situation the Lakers are in they are able to pull through and put their heads in the game. Unlike the celtics, The Lakers never give up and are able to learn from their mistakes.</div>
